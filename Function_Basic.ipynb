        "#  1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.\n",
        "And python is very much popular for his:-\n",
        "- Large standard library\n",
        "- versality\n",
        "- easy to learn\n",
        "- dynamic typing\n",
        "- community services\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "An interpreter in Python is the program that reads and executes Python code line by line, translating it into machine-readable instructions. Unlike compiled languages (like C or Java), which are converted into machine code before execution, Python uses an interpreter to process code dynamically.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meaning in the language. These words are part of Python’s syntax and cannot be used for variable names or identifiers because they serve specific functions in code execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples include:\n",
        "\n",
        "if, else, elif - conditional logic\n",
        "\n",
        "for, while - loops\n",
        "\n",
        "def, class - defining functions and classes\n",
        "\n",
        "True, False, None - boolean and null values\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "Keywords are reserved in Python, so they cannot be used as variable names. If you try, Python will throw a syntax error.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "Mutability refers to an object’s ability to be changed after it is created. In Python, some data types are mutable, meaning their contents can be altered, while others are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once defined.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mutable types -> List, Dictionary, Set, bytearray\n",
        "\n",
        "# 6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "- Lists:\n",
        "Lists are designed to be dynamic collections. we can use add, remove, change element after creation. This makes them useful for tasks where data is expected to change.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Tuples:\n",
        "Tuples are designed to be fixed collections, once created their content can't be changed. This immutability makes them safe usable as dictionary keys or in sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "- == operator:\n",
        "\n",
        "     Checks whether the values of two objects are the same. Does not care if they are stored in the same memory location.\n",
        "- is operator:\n",
        "\n",
        "     Checks whether two variables point to the same object in memory. Even if values are equal, is can be False if they are different objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "In Python, logical operators are used to combine conditional statements and evaluate expressions to a True or False value. They are fundamental for controlling the flow of a program in if statements and while loops. The three logical operators are and, or, and not.\n",
        "\n",
        "- AND operator:\n",
        "Returns True if both conditions are true.Returns False if any one is false.\n",
        "- OR operator:\n",
        "Returns True if at least one condition is true.Returns False only if all are false.\n",
        "- NOT operator:\n",
        "Reverses the result. not True → False, not False → True.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "Type casting means converting one data type into another. In Python, this is usually done using built-in functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "- Implicit:\n",
        "\n",
        "   Done automatically by Python. Converts smaller data types into larger data types to avoid data loss.\n",
        "- Explicit:\n",
        "\n",
        "   Done manually by the programmer using functions. You control the conversion.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "Conditional statements are used to make decisions in a program.\n",
        "They allow the program to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is True or False. this conditional statement is very important in Python for:\n",
        "\n",
        "(1). They give control over the flow of a program.\n",
        "\n",
        "(2). Without conditionals, a program would just run line by line without logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "(3). They help in solving real-world problems where decisions are needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "elif stands for else if. It is used when you have multiple conditions to check. Python checks conditions from top to bottom and executes only the first True block.\n",
        "\n",
        "How it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "First if marks >= 90 → False\n",
        "\n",
        "Then elif marks >= 75 → False\n",
        "\n",
        "Then elif marks >= 50 → True → Executes \"Grade C\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Python stops checking further after the first match.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "Both for and while loops are used for repeating a block of code, but they are used in different situations.\n",
        "\n",
        "- FOR loop:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Used when you know beforehand how many times you want to execute the loop. Iterates over a sequence like a list, tuple, string, or range.\n",
        "- WHILE loop:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Used when you don’t know beforehand how many times the loop will run.Loops until a condition becomes False.\n",
        "\n",
