        "\n",
        "1. Generators produce values one at a time and only when required, rather than computing and storing the entire sequence in memory. This lazy evaluation makes generators highly memory efficient, especially for large datasets or infinite sequences. Regular functions generate all the results at once and store them in memory, which can be impractical for large data.\n",

        "3. Generators maintain their execution state between yields, so each call to next() resumes from where it left off. This allows complex iterators over data without restarting or recomputing values. Regular functions do not preserve state once they return.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Because generators produce values lazily, they can model infinite sequences (e.g., counting numbers, Fibonacci numbers) without running out of memory. Regular functions cannot handle infinite processes as they attempt to generate all values at once.\n",
